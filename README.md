<h3>A Simple CRUD Using PHP/MySQL for Docker Test.</h3>

In this project, I dockerized a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using PHP, MySQL, and Docker.

Initially, this CRUD was built using XAMPP, but now it only requires Docker to run.

Instructions for use:

Install Docker: [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Build the app using: docker compose up --build

Access the app in your preferred web browser. Access index.php: http://localhost:9000/

Access phpMyAdmin. phpMyAdmin: http://localhost:9001/
